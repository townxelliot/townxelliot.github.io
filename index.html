<h1>Some projects</h1>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="slider-puzzle/">Slider Puzzle</a>; requires
Chrome (tested on 27.0.1453.12 dev) or <em>very recent</em>
Firefox (tested on 22.0b3). Unlikely to work properly
on mobile or iOS. But can be deployed to a Tizen device.</p>

<p>NB the app is intended to be used from
a local filesystem: over the web, the images take a while to load
but there are no progress indicators, so please be patient.</p>

<p>Also NB if your brower's locale is set to Finland, the text should appear
in Finnish.</p>

</li>

<li>
<p><a href="mobi-reader/">mobi format ebook reader</a>, an experiment
in reading binary data in the browser. Note that this has no server-side
component: the mobi file unpacking, decompression and parsing is all
done in client-side JavaScript. Also note that the results may vary
in quality (there are some issues with character encodings for some mobi files,
which may result in odd text appearing). I have taken the liberty of ignoring the
table of contents for now. And I only know it works in Chrome (which
supports ArrayBuffer and friends).</p>

<p>This uses the excellent <a href="https://github.com/chrisdickinson/bops">bops</a>
library, which provides a facsimile of node's built in buffer operations
for use in the browser. It's used to read the binary data from the .mobi file.</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/PalmDOC#Format">this page
about PalmDOC</a> (the compression format used inside mobi files) as a reference.
I also adapted some code from <a href="https://github.com/siebert/mobiunpack">mobiunpack</a>.</p>
