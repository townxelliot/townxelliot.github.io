<h1>Technical achievements</h1>

<p>These are examples of some of the code I've written for open source
projects, all of which are available on the web for anyone to review.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>In my previous role at Intel, I contributed
<a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/YoctoProject/contributors/2518465743159763">significant
code</a> to <a href="http://yoctoproject.org/">the Yocto project</a>. Yocto project
tools are used by a range of companies (Wind River, Intel, MontaVista, Freescale,
Texas Instruments) to build embedded Linux distributions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/listview/">I wrote the autodividers widget
for jQuery Mobile</a>. I was pleased with this as it was a commit to a large
public project which (at the time) was used by a lot of people.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/01org/appframework/commits?author=townxelliot">I
contributed a few commits to Intel AppFramework</a>, a kind of jQuery
equivalent. I was pleased with this because I was accepted as a maintainer
of the project very soon after contributing to it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I added <a href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/tracker/commit/?id=c97a660781d3ec1b5c8cdc5349f188a987d9061f">SPARQL
output support to Tracker</a>. I'm proud of this one because it's C code,
and therefore one of the most technically-challenging things I've done.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I made <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/elliot-smith/commits">several
commits to very early versions of Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I wrote a description of
<a href="https://developer.gnome.org/clutter-cookbook/stable/animations-rotating.html">different
rotation types for the Clutter cookbook</a> (among many other recipes). I was pleased with this one
because I think I captured some quite difficult concepts in a natural,
easy-to-remember way ("wheel", "letter box", "door").</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/townxelliot/message-store">Some web service code written in JavaScript</a></p>
<p>I wrote this for an interview task. It demonstrates the approach I take to
coding, documentation, testing etc.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h1>Some projects</h1>

<ul>

<li>
<p><a href="lsystems/examples/index.html">L-Systems</a></p>
<p>These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">interesting mathematical systems
for modelling the morphology of living systems through simple rule sets</a>. I implemented
a basic JavaScript library for parsing L-System rulesets and drawing them in 2D
(with &lt;canvas&gt;) and 3D (WebGL, Sprite3D).</p>
<p>They run quite slowly on my creaky old machine, partly because I never properly
optimised them, but they're still fun. (Looking over the code recently, I
realised I actually learned quite a lot about 3D graphics programming
while working at Intel. There's even some matrix maths in there.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="slider-puzzle/">Slider Puzzle</a>; requires
Chrome or <em>very recent</em> Firefox (tested on 22.0b3). Unlikely to work
properly on mobile or iOS.</p>

<p>NB the app is intended to be used from a local filesystem: over the web, the
images take a while to load but there are no progress indicators, so please be
patient.</p>

<p>Also NB if your brower's locale is set to Finland, the text should appear
in Finnish.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/01org/webapps-slider-puzzle/">(Open)
Source code here</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="mobi-reader/">mobi format ebook reader</a>, an experiment
in reading binary data in the browser. Note that this has no server-side
component: the mobi file unpacking, decompression and parsing is all
done in client-side JavaScript. Also note that the results may vary
in quality (there are some issues with character encodings for some mobi files,
which may result in odd text appearing). I have taken the liberty of ignoring the
table of contents for now. And I only know it works in Chrome (which
supports ArrayBuffer and friends).</p>

<p>This uses the excellent <a href="https://github.com/chrisdickinson/bops">bops</a>
library, which provides a facsimile of node's built in buffer operations
for use in the browser. It's used to read the binary data from the .mobi file.</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/PalmDOC#Format">this page
about PalmDOC</a> (the compression format used inside mobi files) as a reference.
I also adapted some code from <a href="https://github.com/siebert/mobiunpack">mobiunpack</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="es-media-player/app/">es-media-player</a>: A very simple long-format
mp3 player. The key reason I wrote it was to track
progress through multiple podcasts, and keep track of what you listened
to last so you can pick it up again. Similar to what the Audible apps
do, but for your own mp3s, and with a very basic interface designed
to be used by thumbs.</p>

<p>I explain it in more detail
<a href="http://www.townx.org/blog/elliot/experiences-firefox-os-and-zte-open#marconi">in
this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>There's also a <a href="es-media-player/README.md">README</a> in the
application code which may be of interest.</p>

<p>The name is as bland as possible to avoid any copyright infringement
(my initials). Though there is an ES file browser, so I might have
to change it to something else. It was originally called Marconi.</p>
