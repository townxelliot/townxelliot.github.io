<h1>Some projects</h1>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="slider-puzzle/">Slider Puzzle</a>; requires
Chrome (tested on 27.0.1453.12 dev) or <em>very recent</em>
Firefox (tested on 22.0b3). Unlikely to work properly
on mobile or iOS. But can be deployed to a Tizen device.</p>

<p>NB the app is intended to be used from
a local filesystem: over the web, the images take a while to load
but there are no progress indicators, so please be patient.</p>

<p>Also NB if your brower's locale is set to Finland, the text should appear
in Finnish.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="mobi-reader/">mobi format ebook reader</a>, an experiment
in reading binary data in the browser. Note that this has no server-side
component: the mobi file unpacking, decompression and parsing is all
done in client-side JavaScript. Also note that the results may vary
in quality (there are some issues with character encodings for some mobi files,
which may result in odd text appearing). I have taken the liberty of ignoring the
table of contents for now. And I only know it works in Chrome (which
supports ArrayBuffer and friends).</p>

<p>This uses the excellent <a href="https://github.com/chrisdickinson/bops">bops</a>
library, which provides a facsimile of node's built in buffer operations
for use in the browser. It's used to read the binary data from the .mobi file.</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/PalmDOC#Format">this page
about PalmDOC</a> (the compression format used inside mobi files) as a reference.
I also adapted some code from <a href="https://github.com/siebert/mobiunpack">mobiunpack</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="es-media-player/app/">es-media-player</a>: A very simple long-format
mp3 player. The key reason I wrote it was to track
progress through multiple podcasts, and keep track of what you listened
to last so you can pick it up again. Similar to what the Audible apps
do, but for your own mp3s, and with a very basic interface designed
to be used by thumbs.</p>

<p>I explain it in more detail
<a href="http://www.townx.org/blog/elliot/experiences-firefox-os-and-zte-open#marconi">in
this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>There's also a <a href="es-media-player/README.md">README</a> in the
application code which may be of interest.</p>

<p>The name is as bland as possible to avoid any copyright infringement
(my initials). Though there is an ES file browser, so I might have
to change it to something else. It was originally called Marconi.</p>
